Hi there!

Hope you're having a great day! 😊

I've been working on your restaurant POS project and wanted to share something exciting with you.

🎥 I've created a working demo to show you what we can build together!

I know you mentioned wanting something that creates a "WOW" effect - so I built this prototype with a modern, premium design to give you a real feel of the final product.

💡 Here's my approach:

Instead of jumping straight into coding, I'd like to first create complete Figma designs for the entire app. This way:
✅ You'll see exactly what you're getting
✅ We can make changes easily before development
✅ No surprises during the project
✅ Faster development once approved

📊 The app includes 8 main screens:
Login → Sections → Tables → Menu → Products → Quantity → Options → Notes

Plus settings and database configuration.

🎨 About the design:
I've used a dark premium theme with your TANGO orange brand color. It's modern, professional, and has smooth animations throughout.

Does this match your vision? Or would you prefer different colors/style?

🔧 Backend question:
Do you already have a backend/database system? Or should I set that up too?

I can work with:
- SQL Server (like the demo)
- Firebase (great for new projects)
- Any custom API
- Whatever you prefer!

⏰ Timeline:
- Figma designs: ~1 week
- Development: ~3 weeks
- Total: About 1 month

But I'm flexible and can adjust based on your deadline.

💬 Let's chat:
Can we schedule a quick 15-20 minute call to discuss:
1. Your exact requirements
2. Backend setup
3. Timeline
4. Budget

I'm really excited about this project and ready to start right away!

What do you think of the demo? Would love to hear your feedback! 😊

Best,
