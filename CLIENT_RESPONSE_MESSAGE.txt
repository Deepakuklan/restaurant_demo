Hello!

I'm excited to share the premium UI redesign I've created. This goes beyond a simple mockup - it's a fully functional premium experience.

🎨 PREMIUM FEATURES ADDED:

Login Screen:
• Dark gradient background (professional navy/blue theme)
• Animated TANGO logo with glowing orange effects
• Glassmorphism card with frosted glass effect
• Smooth gradient buttons with glow effects
• Premium badge and version indicator

Sections Screen:
• Vibrant gradient cards (different colors for each section)
• Staggered entrance animations - cards appear one by one
• 3D depth with shadow effects and glow
• Decorative background elements
• Icon badges for each section
• Smooth transitions with bounce physics

What Makes It WOW:
✨ Smooth animations on every screen
✨ Modern glassmorphism effects (trendy)
✨ Professional dark theme
✨ Vibrant gradient combinations
✨ Glowing brand elements
✨ Polished micro-interactions

📱 DEMO:
Video: [Upload to YouTube/Drive and add link here]
Live APK: https://ioair.link/wjkcvd (updated with new UI)
Screenshots: [Attach 3-4 key screenshots]

🔥 KEY HIGHLIGHTS:
• This isn't just a visual update - it's a complete premium experience
• Uses latest design trends (glassmorphism, gradients, 3D effects)
• Smooth 60fps animations
• Every detail is polished
• All functionality intact, just elevated design

The moment users open the app, they'll get that "WOW" feeling from:
- The glowing TANGO logo entrance
- Cards smoothly animating in
- The professional dark theme
- The premium gradient effects

This is production-ready and can be deployed immediately. Colors and themes are easily customizable if you'd like any adjustments.

Looking forward to your feedback!

Best regards
