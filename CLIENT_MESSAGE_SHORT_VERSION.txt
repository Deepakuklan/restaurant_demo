  SHORT VERSION - CLIENT MESSAGE
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Hello!

I hope you're doing well. I'm excited to share my work on your restaurant POS project!

🎥 DEMO VIDEO & PROTOTYPE

I've created a working prototype to show you what we can build together:

📱 Demo Video: [YOUR VIDEO LINK]
📦 Live APK: [YOUR APK LINK]
🔑 Login PIN: 1234

This prototype includes all 8 main screens with a modern premium design. I wanted to give you something real to experience rather than just talking about ideas.


🎨 MY PROPOSAL - FIGMA DESIGN FIRST

Here's how I'd like to proceed:

1. Complete Figma Design System
   I'll design the entire app in Figma with all screens, components, and flows. This way you'll see exactly what you're getting before any code is written.

2. Your Approval
   Once you approve the designs, we'll have zero ambiguity during development.

3. Flutter Development
   I'll implement everything pixel-perfect based on the approved Figma designs.


📊 PROJECT SCOPE - PLEASE CONFIRM

Based on my understanding:

SCREENS (8 Total):
✓ Login (PIN authentication)
✓ Sections (Restaurant areas)
✓ Tables (With status: Free/Busy/Reserved)
✓ Menu (Categories)
✓ Products (Items list)
✓ Quantity (Number input)
✓ Terms (Cooking preferences, sides, sauces)
✓ Notes (Seat number, glass count, special notes)

Plus: Settings, Database Config

Are there any other screens or features I should include?


🎨 COLOR THEME - YOUR CONFIRMATION NEEDED

I've used this theme in the prototype:
• Primary: Orange (#FF6B00) - Your TANGO brand color
• Dark professional theme with gradients
• Modern, clean, and premium look

Should I proceed with this, or would you like different colors?


🔧 BACKEND - NEED YOUR INPUT

I can work with any backend solution:

1. SQL Server (like in the prototype)
2. Firebase (recommended for new projects - easy & scalable)
3. Custom API (Node.js, Laravel, etc.)
4. Your existing backend (if you have one)

Questions:
• Do you already have a backend/database?
• What would you prefer for the final product?
• Should I handle backend development too?


📦 WHAT YOU'LL GET

DESIGN:
✓ Complete Figma designs for all screens
✓ Interactive prototype
✓ Unlimited revisions until approved

DEVELOPMENT:
✓ Fully functional Flutter app
✓ Backend integration
✓ Offline mode
✓ Clean, documented code
✓ APK/IPA builds
✓ Source code

SUPPORT:
✓ Testing & bug fixes
✓ 30-day warranty
✓ Deployment help


⏱️ TIMELINE

• Figma Design: 5-7 days
• Development: 15-20 days
• Testing & Deployment: 2-3 days

Total: 3-4 weeks (can adjust based on your needs)


💰 INVESTMENT

I'd like to discuss the exact scope before providing a final quote, but here's a ballpark:

• MVP (Basic features): $XXX - $XXX
• Complete Solution (Recommended): $XXX - $XXX
• Enterprise (Advanced features): $XXX - $XXX

Happy to work within your budget!
